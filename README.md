This project explores machine learning techniques for predicting house prices based on property and location features. Using a dataset of housing attributes, I applied multiple polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships between features and sale prices.

Key steps in the project:

Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing and inconsistent values

Feature scaling and selection of relevant predictors

Implementation of multiple polynomial regression models with varying degrees

Model training, validation, and testing with performance metrics such as RÂ², MAE, and RMSE

Visualization of prediction accuracy and regression fits

The project demonstrates how polynomial regression can improve prediction accuracy over linear models by modeling complex feature interactions.
