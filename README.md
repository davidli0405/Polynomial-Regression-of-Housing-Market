# 🏡 House Price Prediction with Polynomial Regression  

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices using multiple features and **polynomial regression**. The goal is to capture non-linear relationships between property attributes and housing prices to achieve more accurate predictions.

## 📊 Project Overview  
Real estate prices are influenced by a wide variety of factors such as square footage, number of bedrooms, lot size, and location. Traditional linear regression may fail to capture complex patterns in the data. This project applies **multiple polynomial regression** to better model these relationships.

## ⚙️ Features  
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling)  
- Feature engineering to capture non-linear interactions  
- Implementation of **polynomial regression with multiple features**  
- Model evaluation using:  
  - R² (Coefficient of Determination)  
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- Visualization of model predictions vs. actual values  

---

## 📈 Results  
- The model was trained and tested on housing data.  
- Performance metrics such as **R², MAE, and RMSE** were computed.  
- Visualization plots show predicted vs. actual housing prices, as well as regression curves for different polynomial degrees.

## 🎯 Future Improvements  
- Test other regression techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest Regressor)  
- Tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy  
- Explore more real-world datasets for generalization

## 📌 Purpose  
This project was developed as a personal learning exercise to strengthen my understanding of **regression techniques** in machine learning and their application to real-world problems like housing price prediction.
